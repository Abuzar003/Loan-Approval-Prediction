# Loan-Approval-Prediction
This project predicts loan approval based on various features such as applicant income, co-applicant income, loan amount, loan amount term, credit history, and property area. It uses machine learning algorithms to make these predictions.

# Features
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, scales features, and encodes categorical variables.
Model Training: Trains a machine learning model  on the processed data.
Evaluation: Evaluates the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Prediction: Predicts the likelihood of loan approval for new applicants.
