# Loan-Approval-Prediction
This project predicts loan approval using features like applicant income, co-applicant income, loan amount, term, credit history, and property area with machine learning. It handles missing values, scales features, encodes categorical variables, trains models (e.g., Decision Tree), and evaluates using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
